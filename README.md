# Commonwealth Cocktails with Go
The Commonwealth loves making cocktails. We found it frusterating that it was so hard to search cocktails and experience new libations. So we are developing an open source cocktail tool. The tool consists of a database, web interface, Amazon Echo interface, and a whole lot more.

We primarily use Go to develop the backend and MySQL as our database. Everything is built to be deployed to Google App Engine on the Google Cloud Platform. We are using tools like Font Awesome and Bootstrap for our front end.
